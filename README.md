# Interview-Portal

## Description
A simple app where admins can create interviews by selecting participants,
interview start time and end time.

## Basic Requirements

1. An interview creation page where the admin can create an interview by selecting participants, start time and end time. Backend should throw error with proper error message if:
2. Any of the participants is not available during the scheduled time (i.e, has another interview scheduled)
3. No of participants is less than 2
4. An interviews list page where admin can see all the upcoming interviews.
5. Note: No need to add a page to create Users/Participants. Create them directly in the database.

### Setup
To start the app
1. `cd backend and npm install`
2. `cd frontend and cd my-app and npm install`
3. `cd .. and cd ..`
4. `npm start`
5. In another terminal `cd frontend && cd my-app and npm start`

### Project will open on port 3000
